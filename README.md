# Blackjack 3D (Android)

## Overview
This project is a 3D implementation of the classic casino game Blackjack, developed using Unity. It features realistic 3D card animations, an intuitive user interface, and adheres to standard Blackjack rules.

## Key Features
- Fully 3D environment with animated card dealing and flipping.
- Realistic card physics and interactions
- Multiple local players.
- Highly customizable visual themes and parameters.
- Intuitive UI for player actions (Hit, Stand)
- Accurate Blackjack rules implementation.

## Technical Highlights
- Coroutine-based animation system for smooth card movements.
- Event-driven architecture, with decoupled and expandable logic and view.
- Modular code structure for easy expansion and maintenance.

## Development Process
The entire application took me 3 weeks to complete and it's completely made with C# and the Unity Engine (no shaders). The objective of this project was to practice a decoupled architecture, and the complete game production cycle with a simple game to showcase in my portfolio.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement "Split" and "Double" logic and animations.
- Additional casino ambient sounds and visual effects.
- Implement a betting system.
- Integration with a broader casino game suite.
